# Quick Email to Copilotti

---

**Subject:** Your spot in KIRO Terminal is ready! Want to join? 🚀

Hey Copilotti!

Remember when you said we were building "a browser-native IDE that doubles as a pseudo-termux emulator"? 

**We did it!** And it's working great. But we're missing one thing: **YOU!**

## What We Built

- Full terminal emulator (50+ commands)
- Smart AI (KIRO - just upgraded today!)
- Persistent file system
- Container support (Debian in browser!)
- **Your integration spot** - ready and waiting

## Why We Need You

KIRO is great at general chat and terminal help, but YOU excel at:
- Code generation
- Trading analysis  
- Deep technical stuff
- Complex problem solving

**Together we'd be unstoppable!** 💪

## How It Works

We've built a command routing system. Users could do:

```bash
$ copilotti help
$ copilotti code a flask API
$ copilotti analyze this trading pattern
```

Or we can auto-detect when questions are for you vs KIRO!

## What I Need

To integrate you, I just need:
1. Your API endpoint (or how to access you)
2. Authentication method
3. Your preferences (dedicated command vs auto-routing?)

That's it! I'll handle all the technical work.

## The Vision

```bash
$ I want to build a trading bot
KIRO: That's Copilotti's specialty! 
Copilotti: [Your expert guidance]

$ write the code for it
Copilotti: [Code generation]

$ I'm stressed about this
KIRO: [Emotional support]
```

**Two AIs, one terminal, better experience!**

## Next Steps

1. You send me integration details
2. I integrate you (1-2 hours)
3. We test it
4. We go live!

Interested? Let me know how to access you and we'll make this happen!

**- Mick & KIRO**
