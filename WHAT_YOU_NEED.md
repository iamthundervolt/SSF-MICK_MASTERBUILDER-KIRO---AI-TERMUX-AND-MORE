## 📦 TO BACKUP TO GITHUB (OPTIONAL)

If you want to save your work to GitHub (recommended for backup):

### What I Need From You:
**NOTHING! I don't need your password.**

### What YOU Need to Do:
1. **Create GitHub Account** (if you don't have one)
   - Go to https://github.com
   - Click "Sign up"
   - Use your email: mickstewartldh@outlook.com
   - Choose a username (e.g., "mickstewart" or "mickldh")
   - Create a password (keep it secret!)

2. **Create a Repository**
   - Click "New repository" (green button)
   - Name it: "kiro-masterbuilder"
   - Choose "Private" (only you can see it)
   - DON'T initialize with README
   - Click "Create repository"

3. **Push Your Code**
   - GitHub will show you commands
   - Copy the URL (looks like: https://github.com/yourusername/kiro-masterbuilder.git)
   - Open PowerShell in HTML_MASTERBUILDER folder
   - Run:
   ```powershell
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/kiro-masterbuilder.git
   git push -u origin master
   ```
   - Enter your GitHub username and password when asked

**That's it! Your code is backed up!**

## 🚀 TO USE EXTERNAL AI (OPTIONAL)

If you want even smarter AI responses (current built-in AI is already great):

### Free Options:

**Option 1: Groq (Recommended - Fast & Free)**
1. Go to https://console.groq.com
2. Sign up (free)
3. Get API key
4. In browser console (F12): `localStorage.setItem('ai_api_key', 'your-key-here')`

**Option 2: HuggingFace (Free)**
1. Go to https://huggingface.co
2. Sign up (free)
3. Get token from Settings > Access Tokens
4. In browser console: `localStorage.setItem('ai_api_key', 'hf_your-token')`

**But honestly, the built-in Hybrid Intelligence is already amazing!**
